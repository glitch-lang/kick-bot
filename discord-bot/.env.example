# Kick Bot API URL
KICK_BOT_API_URL=https://web-production-56232.up.railway.app

#   PUBLIC_URL=https://watchparty.yourdomain.com
#   PUBLIC_URL=https://your-app.railway.app

PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3001

# LocalTunnel Configuration (OPTIONAL - for automatic public access)
# Set to 'true' to automatically create a public URL when bot starts
# This eliminates the need to manually run 'lt --port 3001'

# Browser Streaming Configuration (OPTIONAL - for voice channel audio streaming)
# Required only if you want to stream Kick audio directly to Discord voice channels
# Watch parties DON'T need this - they work out of the box!
# 
# To enable browser streaming locally:
# 1. Install Chrome/Chromium on your system
# 2. Set CHROME_PATH to your Chrome executable:
#    Windows: C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
#    Mac: /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome
#    Linux: /usr/bin/chromium-browser or /usr/bin/google-chrome
#
# Note: Browser streaming is NOT available on Railway (no Chromium installed)
# Use watch parties instead - they provide a better experience anyway!
